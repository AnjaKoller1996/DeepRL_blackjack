basic blackjack implementations with deep RL
In this file we explain what you can find in which file and the sources we used for the code. 
We modified the code from the website for better readability and analysis. 
We solved Blackjack using Qlearning, SARSA and Qlearning with Neural networks (DeepQlearning). 
These are all Reinforcement learning techniques. 
The main code sources where:

1) Q-learning: 

--> 

2) SARSA: 

3) Deep Q-learning:
